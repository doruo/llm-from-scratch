      "\n",
      "While looking, I saw two eagles circling about the summit of a lofty\n",
      "tower. I soon became satisfied that there was a nest. Now, in all my\n",
      "collection, I lacked eggs of the native eagle and the large owl.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mind was made up. I would reach the summit of that tower, or perish\n",
      "in the attempt. I went nearer, and surveyed the ruins. The old\n",
      "staircase, years before, had fallen in. The outer walls were, however,\n",
      "intact. There was no chance that way, unless I looked to the ivy solely\n",
      "for support. This was, as I soon found out, futile.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remained the chimney, which still went up to the top, and had once\n",
      "served to carry off the smoke from every story of the tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up this I determined to venture. It was narrow, rough, and therefore the\n",
      "more easily climbed. I took off my coat and crept into the chimney.\n",
      "Looking up, I saw a small, light opening, proclaiming the summit of the\n",
      "chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up--up I went, for some time using my hands and knees, after the fashion\n",
      "of a chimney sweep. It was slow work, but, there being continual\n",
      "projections, the task was comparatively easy. In this way, I reached\n",
      "halfway. The chimney now became narrower. The atmosphere was close, and,\n",
      "at last, to end the matter, I stuck fast. I could ascend no higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be no doubt of this, and there remained no resource but to\n",
      "descend, and give up my glorious prey in despair. I yielded to fate and\n",
      "endeavored to descend. But I could not move. Some unseen and mysterious\n",
      "obstacle intervened and stopped me. In an instant the full horror of my\n",
      "situation seized me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was unable to move either way, and was doomed to a terrible and\n",
      "horrible death, that of starvation. In a boy's mind, however, there is\n",
      "an extraordinary amount of elasticity and hope, and I began to think of\n",
      "all sorts of plans to escape my gloomy fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, I required no food just at present, having had an\n",
      "excellent meal, and was therefore allowed time for reflection. My first\n",
      "thought was to try and move the mortar with my hand. Had I possessed a\n",
      "knife, something might have been done, but that useful instrument I had\n",
      "left in my coat pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "I soon found that all efforts of this kind were vain and useless, and\n",
      "that all I could hope to do was to wriggle downwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though I jerked and struggled, and strove to turn, it was all in\n",
      "vain. I could not move an inch, one way or the other. And time flew\n",
      "rapidly. My early rising probably contributed to the fact that I felt\n",
      "sleepy, and gradually gave way to the sensation of drowsiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I slept, and awoke in darkness, ravenously hungry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night had come, and still I could not move. I was tight bound, and did\n",
      "not succeed in changing my position an inch. I groaned aloud. Never\n",
      "since the days of my happy childhood, when it was a hardship to go from\n",
      "meal to meal without eating, had I really experienced hunger. The\n",
      "sensation was as novel as it was painful. I began now to lose my head\n",
      "and to scream and cry out in my agony. Something appeared, startled by\n",
      "my noise. It was a harmless lizard, but it appeared to me a loathsome\n",
      "reptile. Again I made the old ruins resound with my cries, and finally\n",
      "so exhausted myself that I fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long I lay in a kind of trance or sleep I cannot say, but when again\n",
      "I recovered consciousness it was day. How ill I felt, how hunger still\n",
      "gnawed at me, it would be hard to say. I was too weak to scream now, far\n",
      "too weak to struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly I was startled by a roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you there, Henry?\" said the voice of my uncle; \"are you there, my\n",
      "boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I could only faintly respond, but I also made a desperate effort to\n",
      "turn. Some mortar fell. To this I owed my being discovered. When the\n",
      "search took place, it was easily seen that mortar and small pieces of\n",
      "stone had recently fallen from above. Hence my uncle's cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be calm,\" he cried, \"if we pull down the whole ruin, you shall be\n",
      "saved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were delicious words, but I had little hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon however, about a quarter of an hour later I heard a voice above me,\n",
      "at one of the upper fireplaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you below or above?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Below,\" was my reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant a basket was lowered with milk, a biscuit, and an egg. My\n",
      "uncle was fearful to be too ready with his supply of food. I drank the\n",
      "milk first, for thirst had nearly deadened hunger. I then, much\n",
      "refreshed, ate my bread and hard egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now at work at the wall. I could hear a pickax. Wishing to\n",
      "escape all danger from this terrible weapon I made a desperate struggle,\n",
      "and the belt, which surrounded my waist and which had been hitched on a\n",
      "stone, gave way. I was free, and only escaped falling down by a rapid\n",
      "motion of my hands and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten minutes more I was in my uncle's arms, after being two days and\n",
      "nights in that horrible prison. My occasional delirium prevented me from\n",
      "counting time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was weeks recovering from that awful starvation adventure; and yet\n",
      "what was that to the hideous sufferings I now endured?\n",
      "\n",
      "After dreaming for some time, and thinking of this and other matters, I\n",
      "once more looked around me. We were still ascending with fearful\n",
      "rapidity. Every now and then the air appeared to check our respiration\n",
      "as it does that of aeronauts when the ascension of the balloon is too\n",
      "rapid. But if they feel a degree of cold in proportion to the elevation\n",
      "they attain in the atmosphere, we experienced quite a contrary effect.\n",
      "The heat began to increase in a most threatening and exceptional manner.\n",
      "I cannot tell exactly the mean, but I think it must have reached one\n",
      "hundred twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the meaning of this extraordinary change in the temperature? As\n",
      "far as we had hitherto gone, facts had proved the theories of Davy and\n",
      "of Lidenbrock to be correct. Until now, all the peculiar conditions of\n",
      "refractory rocks, of electricity, of magnetism, had modified the general\n",
      "laws of nature, and had created for us a moderate temperature; for the\n",
      "theory of the central fire, remained, in my eyes, the only explainable\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were we, then, going to reach a position in which these phenomena were\n",
      "to be carried out in all their rigor, and in which the heat would reduce\n",
      "the rocks to a state of fusion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was my not unnatural fear, and I did not conceal the fact from my\n",
      "uncle. My way of doing so might be cold and heartless, but I could not\n",
      "help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we are not drowned, or smashed into pancakes, and if we do not die\n",

      "burned alive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My uncle, in presence of this brusque attack, simply shrugged his\n",
      "shoulders, and resumed his reflections--whatever they might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour passed away, and except that there was a slight increase in the\n",

      "\n",

      "decision, like a being without energy.\"\n",

      "without satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans, the guide, just as if he had been eider-down hunting, swallowed\n",

      "equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans, in all probability, was no more used to starvation than ourselves,\n",

      "\n",
      "The most fortunate thing! Had my uncle really and truly gone mad? What\n",
      "did he mean by these awful words--what did he mean by this terrible\n",
      "calm, this solemn smile?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" cried I, in the height of my exasperation, \"we are on the way to\n",
      "an eruption, are we? Fatality has cast us into a well of burning and\n",
      "boiling lava, of rocks on fire, of boiling water, in a word, filled with\n",
      "every kind of eruptive matter? We are about to be expelled, thrown up,\n",
      "vomited, spit out of the interior of the earth, in common with huge\n",
      "blocks of granite, with showers of cinders and scoriae, in a wild\n",
      "whirlwind of flame, and you say--the most fortunate thing which could\n",
      "happen to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, looking at me calmly from under his\n",
      "spectacles, \"it is the only chance which remains to us of ever escaping\n",
      "from the interior of the earth to the light of day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is quite impossible that I can put on paper the thousand strange,\n",
      "wild thoughts which followed this extraordinary announcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my uncle was right, quite right, and never had he appeared to me so\n",
      "audacious and so convinced as when he looked me calmly in the face and\n",
      "spoke of the chances of an eruption--of our being cast upon Mother Earth\n",
      "once more through the gaping crater of a volcano!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, while we were speaking we were still ascending; we passed\n",
      "the whole night going up, or to speak more scientifically, in an\n",
      "ascensional motion. The fearful noise redoubled; I was ready to\n",
      "suffocate. I seriously believed that my last hour was approaching, and\n",
      "yet, so strange is imagination, all I thought of was some childish\n",
      "hypothesis or other. In such circumstances you do not choose your own\n",
      "thoughts. They overcome you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite evident that we were being cast upwards by eruptive matter;\n",
      "under the raft there was a mass of boiling water, and under this was a\n",
      "heavier mass of lava, and an aggregate of rocks which, on reaching the\n",
      "summit of the water, would be dispersed in every direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "That we were inside the chimney of a volcano there could no longer be\n",
      "the shadow of a doubt. Nothing more terrible could be conceived!\n",
      "\n",
      "But on this occasion, instead of Sneffels, an old and extinct volcano,\n",
      "we were inside a mountain of fire in full activity. Several times I\n",
      "found myself asking, what mountain was it, and on what part of the world\n",
      "we should be shot out. As if it were of any consequence!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the northern regions, there could be no reasonable doubt about that.\n",
      "Before it went decidedly mad, the compass had never made the slightest\n",
      "mistake. From the cape of Saknussemm, we had been swept away to the\n",
      "northward many hundreds of leagues. Now the question was, were we once\n",
      "more under Iceland--should we be belched forth on to the earth through\n",
      "the crater of Mount Hecla, or should we reappear through one of the\n",
      "other seven fire funnels of the island? Taking in my mental vision a\n",
      "radius of five hundred leagues to the westward, I could see under this\n",
      "parallel only the little-known volcanoes of the northwest coast of\n",
      "America.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the east one only existed somewhere about the eightieth degree of\n",
      "latitude, the Esk, upon the island of Jan Mayen, not far from the frozen\n",
      "regions of Spitsbergen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not craters that were wanting, and many of them were big enough\n",
      "to vomit a whole army; all I wished to know was the particular one\n",
      "towards which we were making with such fearful velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often think now of my folly: as if I should ever have expected to\n",
      "escape!\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards morning, the ascending motion became greater and greater. If the\n",
      "degree of heat increased instead of decreasing, as we approached the\n",
      "surface of the earth, it was simply because the causes were local and\n",
      "wholly due to volcanic influence. Our very style of locomotion left in\n",
      "my mind no doubt upon the subject. An enormous force, a force of several\n",
      "hundreds of atmospheres produced by the vapors accumulated and long\n",
      "compressed in the interior of the earth, was hoisting us upwards with\n",
      "irresistible power.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though we were approaching the light of day, to what fearful dangers\n",
      "were we about to be exposed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Instant death appeared the only fate which we could expect or\n",
      "contemplate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon a dim, sepulchral light penetrated the vertical gallery, which\n",
      "became wider and wider. I could make out to the right and left long dark\n",
      "corridors like immense tunnels, from which awful and horrid vapors\n",
      "poured out. Tongues of fire, sparkling and crackling, appeared about to\n",
      "lick us up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hour had come!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, Uncle, look!\" I cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what you see are the great sulphurous flames. Nothing more common\n",
      "in connection with an eruption.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if they lap us round!\" I angrily replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They will not lap us round,\" was his quiet and serene answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it will be all the same in the end if they stifle us,\" I cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall not be stifled. The gallery is rapidly becoming wider and\n",
      "wider, and if it be necessary, we will presently leave the raft and take\n",
      "refuge in some fissure in the rock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the water, the water, which is continually ascending?\" I\n",
      "despairingly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no longer any water, Harry,\" he answered, \"but a kind of lava\n",
      "paste, which is heaving us up, in company with itself, to the mouth of\n",
      "the crater.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, the liquid column of water had wholly disappeared to give\n",
      "place to dense masses of boiling eruptive matter. The temperature was\n",
      "becoming utterly insupportable, and a thermometer exposed to this\n",
      "atmosphere would have marked between one hundred and eighty-nine and one\n",
      "hundred ninety degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perspiration rushed from every pore. But for the extraordinary rapidity\n",
      "of our ascent we should have been stifled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the Professor did not carry out his proposition of\n",
      "abandoning the raft; and he did quite wisely. Those few ill-joined beams\n",
      "offered, anyway, a solid surface--a support which elsewhere must have\n",
      "utterly failed us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards eight o'clock in the morning a new incident startled us. The\n",
      "ascensional movement suddenly ceased. The raft became still and\n",
      "motionless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter now?\" I said, querulously, very much startled by\n",
      "this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A simple halt,\" replied my uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is the eruption about to fail?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without making any reply, I rose. I tried to look around me. Perhaps the\n",
      "raft, checked by some projecting rock, opposed a momentary resistance to\n",
      "the eruptive mass. In this case, it was absolutely necessary to release\n",
      "it as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing of the kind had occurred. The column of cinders, of scoriae, of\n",
      "broken rocks and earth, had wholly ceased to ascend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you, Uncle, that the eruption has stopped,\" was my oracular\n",
      "decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said my uncle, \"you think so, my boy. You are wrong. Do not be in\n",
      "the least alarmed; this sudden moment of calm will not last long, be\n",
      "assured. It has already endured five minutes, and before we are many\n",
      "minutes older we shall be continuing our journey to the mouth of the\n",
      "crater.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time he was speaking the Professor continued to consult his\n",
      "chronometer, and he was probably right in his prognostics. Soon the raft\n",
      "resumed its motion, in a very rapid and disorderly way, which lasted two\n",
      "minutes or thereabout; and then again it stopped as suddenly as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good,\" said my uncle, observing the hour, \"in ten we shall start\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In ten minutes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--precisely. We have to do with a volcano, the eruption of which is\n",
      "intermittent. We are compelled to breathe just as it does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more true. At the exact minute he had indicated, we\n",
      "were again launched on high with extreme rapidity. Not to be cast off\n",
      "the raft, it was necessary to hold on to the beams. Then the hoist again\n",
      "ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times since have I thought of this singular phenomenon without\n",
      "being able to find for it any satisfactory explanation. Nevertheless, it\n",
      "appeared quite clear to me, that we were not in the principal chimney of\n",
      "the volcano, but in an accessory conduit, where we felt the counter\n",
      "shock of the great and principal tunnel filled by burning lava.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible for me to say how many times this maneuver was\n",
      "repeated. All that I can remember is, that on every ascensional motion,\n",
      "we were hoisted up with ever increasing velocity, as if we had been\n",
      "launched from a huge projectile. During the sudden halts we were nearly\n",
      "stifled; during the moments of projection the hot air took away our\n",
      "breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought for a moment of the voluptuous joy of suddenly finding myself\n",
      "in the hyperborean regions with the cold thirty degrees below zero!\n",
      "\n",
      "My exalted imagination pictured to itself the vast snowy plains of the\n",
      "arctic regions, and I was impatient to roll myself on the icy carpet of\n",
      "the North Pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "By degrees my head, utterly overcome by a series of violent emotions,\n",

      "\n",
      "The eider-down hunter simply shrugged his shoulders as a mark of total\n",
      "ignorance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Iceland?\" said I, not positively but interrogatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nej,\" said Hans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you mean?\" cried the Professor; \"no--what are your reasons?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hans is wrong,\" said I, rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all the innumerable surprises of this journey, a yet more singular\n",
      "one was reserved to us. I expected to see a cone covered by snow, by\n",
      "extensive and widespread glaciers, in the midst of the arid deserts of\n",
      "the extreme northern regions, beneath the full rays of a polar sky,\n",
      "beyond the highest latitudes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But contrary to all our expectations, I, my uncle, and the Icelander,\n",
      "were cast upon the slope of a mountain calcined by the burning rays of a\n",
      "sun which was literally baking us with its fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not believe my eyes, but the actual heat which affected my body\n",
      "allowed me no chance of doubting. We came out of the crater half naked,\n",
      "and the radiant star from which we had asked nothing for two months, was\n",
      "good enough to be prodigal to us of light and warmth--a light and warmth\n",
      "we could easily have dispensed with.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our eyes were accustomed to the light we had lost sight of so long,\n",
      "I used them to rectify the errors of my imagination. Whatever happened,\n",
      "we should have been at Spitsbergen, and I was in no humor to yield to\n",
      "anything but the most absolute proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some delay, the Professor spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hem!\" he said, in a hesitating kind of way, \"it really does not look\n",
      "like Iceland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But supposing it were the island of Jan Mayen?\" I ventured to observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least, my boy. This is not one of the volcanoes of the\n",
      "north, with its hills of granite and its crown of snow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nevertheless--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, look, my boy,\" said the Professor, as dogmatically as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right above our heads, at a great height, opened the crater of a volcano\n",
      "from which escaped, from one quarter of an hour to the other, with a\n",
      "very loud explosion, a lofty jet of flame mingled with pumice stone,\n",
      "cinders, and lava. I could feel the convulsions of nature in the\n",
      "mountain, which breathed like a huge whale, throwing up from time to\n",
      "time fire and air through its enormous vents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below, and floating along a slope of considerable angularity, the stream\n",
      "of eruptive matter spread away to a depth which did not give the volcano\n",
      "a height of three hundred fathoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its base disappeared in a perfect forest of green trees, among which I\n",
      "perceived olives, fig trees, and vines loaded with rich grapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly this was not the ordinary aspect of the arctic regions. About\n",
      "that there could not be the slightest doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the eye was satisfied at its glimpse of this verdant expanse, it\n",
      "fell upon the waters of a lovely sea or beautiful lake, which made of\n",
      "this enchanted land an island of not many leagues in extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the side of the rising sun was to be seen a little port, crowded with\n",
      "houses, and near which the boats and vessels of peculiar build were\n",
      "floating upon azure waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond, groups of islands rose above the liquid plain, so numerous and\n",
      "close together as to resemble a vast beehive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the setting sun, some distant shores were to be made out on the\n",
      "edge of the horizon. Some presented the appearance of blue mountains of\n",
      "harmonious conformation; upon others, much more distant, there appeared\n",
      "a prodigiously lofty cone, above the summit of which hung dark and heavy\n",
      "clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the north, an immense expanse of water sparkled beneath the\n",
      "solar rays, occasionally allowing the extremity of a mast or the\n",
      "convexity of a sail bellying to the wind, to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unexpected character of such a scene added a hundredfold to its\n",
      "marvelous beauties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where can we be?\" I asked, speaking in a low and solemn voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hans shut his eyes with an air of indifference, and my uncle looked on\n",
      "without clearly understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever this mountain may be,\" he said, at last, \"I must confess it is\n",
      "rather warm. The explosions do not leave off, and I do not think it is\n",
      "worthwhile to have left the interior of a volcano and remain here to\n",
      "receive a huge piece of rock upon one's head. Let us carefully descend\n",
      "the mountain and discover the real state of the case. To confess the\n",
      "truth, I am dying of hunger and thirst.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Decidedly the Professor was no longer a truly reflective character. For\n",
      "myself, forgetting all my necessities, ignoring my fatigues and\n",
      "sufferings, I should have remained still for several hours longer--but\n",
      "it was necessary to follow my companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slope of the volcano was very steep and slippery; we slid over piles\n",
      "of ashes, avoiding the streams of hot lava which glided about like fiery\n",
      "serpents. Still, while we were advancing, I spoke with extreme\n",
      "volubility, for my imagination was too full not to explode in words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are in Asia!\" I exclaimed; \"we are on the coast of India, in the\n",
      "great Malay islands, in the centre of Oceania. We have crossed the one\n",
      "half of the globe to come out right at the antipodes of Europe!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the compass!\" exclaimed my uncle; \"explain that to me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--the compass,\" I said with considerable hesitation. \"I grant that\n",
      "is a difficulty. According to it, we have always been going northward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it lied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hem--to say it lied is rather a harsh word,\" was my answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then we are at the North Pole--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Pole--no--well--well I give it up,\" was my reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plain truth was, that there was no explanation possible. I could\n",
      "make nothing of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the while we were approaching this beautiful verdure, hunger and\n",
      "thirst tormented me fearfully. Happily, after two long hours' march, a\n",
      "beautiful country spread out before us, covered by olives, pomegranates,\n",
      "and vines, which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody. In any\n",
      "event, in the state of destitution into which we had fallen, we were not\n",
      "in a mood to ponder too scrupulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "What delight it was to press these delicious fruits to our lips, and to\n",
      "bite at grapes and pomegranates fresh from the vine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far off, near some fresh and mossy grass, under the delicious shade\n",
      "of some trees, I discovered a spring of fresh water, in which we\n",
      "voluptuously laved our faces, hands, and feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were all giving way to the delights of new-found pleasures, a\n",
      "little child appeared between two tufted olive trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" cried I, \"an inhabitant of this happy country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The little fellow was poorly dressed, weak, and suffering, and appeared\n",
      "terribly alarmed at our appearance. Half-naked, with tangled, matted and\n",
      "ragged beards, we did look supremely ill-favored; and unless the country\n",
      "was a bandit land, we were not likely to alarm the inhabitants!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the boy was about to take to his heels, Hans ran after him, and\n",
      "brought him back, despite his cries and kicks.\n",
      "\n",
      "My uncle tried to look as gentle as possible, and then spoke in German.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the name of this mountain, my friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The child made no reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good,\" said my uncle, with a very positive air of conviction, \"we are\n",
      "not in Germany.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then made the same demand in English, of which language he was an\n",
      "excellent scholar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child shook its head and made no reply. I began to be considerably\n",
      "puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he dumb?\" cried the Professor, who was rather proud of his polyglot\n",
      "knowledge of languages, and made the same demand in French.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy only stared in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must perforce try him in Italian,\" said my uncle, with a shrug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"<i>Dove noi siamo</i>?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, tell me where we are?\" I added impatiently and eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the boy remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My fine fellow, do you or do you not mean to speak?\" cried my uncle,\n",
      "who began to get angry. He shook him, and spoke another dialect of the\n",
      "Italian language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"<i>Come si noma questa isola</i>?\"--\"What is the name of this island?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stromboli,\" replied the rickety little shepherd, dashing away from Hans\n",
      "and disappearing in the olive groves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We thought little enough about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stromboli! What effect on the imagination did these few words produce!\n",
      "We were in the centre of the Mediterranean, amidst the eastern\n",
      "archipelago of mythological memory, in the ancient Strongylos, where\n",
      "AEolus kept the wind and the tempest chained up. And those blue\n",
      "mountains, which rose towards the rising sun, were the mountains of\n",
      "Calabria.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that mighty volcano which rose on the southern horizon was Etna, the\n",
      "fierce and celebrated Etna!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stromboli! Stromboli!\" I repeated to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "My uncle played a regular accompaniment to my gestures and words. We\n",
      "were singing together like an ancient chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah--what a journey--what a marvelous and extraordinary journey! Here we\n",
      "had entered the earth by one volcano, and we had come out by another.\n",
      "And this other was situated more than twelve hundred leagues from\n",
      "Sneffels from that drear country of Iceland cast away on the confines of\n",
      "the earth. The wondrous changes of this expedition had transported us to\n",
      "the most harmonious and beautiful of earthly lands. We had abandoned the\n",
      "region of eternal snows for that of infinite verdure, and had left over\n",
      "our heads the gray fog of the icy regions to come back to the azure sky\n",
      "of Sicily!\n",
      "\n",
      "After a delicious repast of fruits and fresh water, we again continued\n",
      "our journey in order to reach the port of Stromboli. To say how we had\n",
      "reached the island would scarcely have been prudent. The superstitious\n",
      "character of the Italians would have been at work, and we should have\n",
      "been called demons vomited from the infernal regions. It was therefore\n",
      "necessary to pass for humble and unfortunate shipwrecked travelers. It\n",
      "was certainly less striking and romantic, but it was decidedly safer.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we advanced, I could hear my worthy uncle muttering to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the compass. The compass most certainly marked north. This is a\n",
      "fact I cannot explain in any way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the fact is,\" said I, with an air of disdain, \"we must not\n",
      "explain anything. It will be much more easy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to see a professor of the Johanneum Institution who is\n",
      "unable to explain a cosmic phenomenon--it would indeed be strange.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And speaking thus, my uncle, half-naked, his leathern purse round his\n",
      "loins, and his spectacles upon his nose, became once more the terrible\n",
      "Professor of Mineralogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour after leaving the wood of olives, we reached the fort of San\n",
      "Vicenza, where Hans demanded the price of his thirteenth week of\n",
      "service. My uncle paid him, with very many warm shakes of the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, if he did not indeed quite share our natural emotion, he\n",
      "allowed his feelings so far to give way as to indulge in an\n",
      "extraordinary expression for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the tips of two fingers he gently pressed our hands and smiled.\n",

      "This is the final conclusion of a narrative which will be probably\n",
      "disbelieved even by people who are astonished at nothing. I am, however,\n",
      "armed at all points against human incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were kindly received by the Strombolite fishermen, who treated us as\n",
      "shipwrecked travelers. They gave us clothes and food. After a delay of\n",
      "forty-eight hours, on the 30th of September a little vessel took us to\n",
      "Messina, where a few days of delightful and complete repose restored us\n",
      "to ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, the 4th of October, we embarked in the Volturne, one of the\n",
      "postal packets of the Imperial Messageries of France; and three days\n",
      "later we landed at Marseilles, having no other care on our minds but\n",
      "that of our precious but erratic compass. This inexplicable circumstance\n",
      "tormented me terribly. On the 9th of October, in the evening, we reached\n",
      "Hamburg.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the astonishment of Martha, what the joy of Gretchen! I will\n",
      "not attempt to define it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now then, Harry, that you really are a hero,\" she said, \"there is no\n",
      "reason why you should ever leave me again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at her. She was weeping tears of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I leave it to be imagined if the return of Professor Hardwigg made or\n",
      "did not make a sensation in Hamburg. Thanks to the indiscretion of\n",
      "Martha, the news of his departure for the interior of the earth had been\n",
      "spread over the whole world.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one would believe it--and when they saw him come back in safety they\n",
      "believed it all the less.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the presence of Hans and many stray scraps of information by degrees\n",
      "modified public opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then my uncle became a great man and I the nephew of a great man, which,\n",
      "at all events, is something. Hamburg gave a festival in our honor. A\n",
      "public meeting of the Johanneum Institution was held, at which the\n",
      "Professor related the whole story of his adventures, omitting only the\n",
      "facts in connection with the compass.\n",
      "\n",
      "That same day he deposited in the archives of the town the document he\n",
      "had found written by Saknussemm, and he expressed his great regret that\n",
      "circumstances, stronger than his will, did not allow him to follow the\n",
      "Icelandic traveler's track into the very centre of the earth. He was\n",
      "modest in his glory, but his reputation only increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much honor necessarily created for him many envious enemies. Of\n",
      "course they existed, and as his theories, supported by certain facts,\n",
      "contradicted the system of science upon the question of central heat, he\n",
      "maintained his own views both with pen and speech against the learned of\n",
      "every country. Although I still believe in the theory of central heat, I\n",
      "confess that certain circumstances, hitherto very ill defined, may\n",
      "modify the laws of such natural phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when these questions were being discussed with interest,\n",
      "my uncle received a rude shock--one that he felt very much. Hans,\n",
      "despite everything he could say to the contrary, quitted Hamburg; the\n",
      "man to whom we owed so much would not allow us to pay our deep debt of\n",
      "gratitude. He was taken with nostalgia; a love for his Icelandic home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Farval,\" said he, one day, and with this one short word of adieu, he\n",
      "started for Reykjavik, which he soon reached in safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were deeply attached to our brave eider-duck hunter. His absence will\n",
      "never cause him to be forgotten by those whose lives he saved, and I\n",
      "hope, at some not distant day, to see him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, I may say that our journey into the interior of the earth\n",
      "created an enormous sensation throughout the civilized world. It was\n",
      "translated and printed in many languages. All the leading journals\n",
      "published extracts from it, which were commentated, discussed, attacked,\n",
      "and supported with equal animation by those who believed in its\n",
      "episodes, and by those who were utterly incredulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful! My uncle enjoyed during his lifetime all the glory he\n",
      "deserved; and he was even offered a large sum of money, by Mr. Barnum,\n",
      "to exhibit himself in the United States; while I am credibly informed by\n",
      "a traveler that he is to be seen in waxwork at Madame Tussaud's!\n",
      "\n",
      "But one care preyed upon his mind, a care which rendered him very\n",
      "unhappy. One fact remained inexplicable--that of the compass. For a\n",
      "learned man to be baffled by such an inexplicable phenomenon was very\n",
      "aggravating. But Heaven was merciful, and in the end my uncle was happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, while he put some minerals belonging to his collection in\n",
      "order, I fell upon the famous compass and examined it keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For six months it had lain unnoticed and untouched.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A clear light fell upon our minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here it is!\" he cried, as soon as he had recovered the use of his\n",
      "speech, \"after we had once passed Cape Saknussemm, the needle of this\n",
      "compass pointed to the southward instead of the northward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Evidently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our error is now easily explained. But to what phenomenon do we owe\n",
